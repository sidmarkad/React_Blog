Points to note:
There are no designs/layouts/mock-up provided to you. You are expected to design it on your own. You can pickup any ready to use templates, but you will be answerable on why you chosen it.  

You are expected to use the Graphql APIs. 
Decide where you will need mutations/queries to use. 
You are also expected to use react-apollo client to interact with graphql APIs. 

It will be a great advantage to you if you use Tailwind CSS framework.
